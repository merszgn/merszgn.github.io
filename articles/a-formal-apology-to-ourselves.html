        <main>
            <p>I once read a story about how we as humans were never meant to see our own faces. We are all born with
                features unique to each of us, crafted by generations of ancestors and love. However, no matter how
                unique you might be, we all possess one common denominator very exclusive to our human minds and nature:
                the ability to critique. This ability was never meant to be used against one another, especially not
                ourselves.
            </p>
            <p> I found a photograph of a younger version of myself and my little brother from a little over a decade
                ago. He was a newborn and she had just recently turned six years old. My immediate thought when I saw
                this photo was to admire her eyes. They hold an almond shape, big, dark brown irises, long eyelashes
                that droop into her eyes, and the noticeably abundant amount of veins on her eyelids. Despite all of
                these familiar features, I cannot help but dissociate myself from her. She is not me. I could never be
                her. My heart activates a part of itself that sends warning signals to my brain, forbidding it from
                letting me recognize this girl. Somewhere deep inside my psyche, I know all too well that if I were to
                know her as a part of myself, there would be nothing stopping me from digging into every piece of her
                face and listing everything I hate about it. I could spend ages criticizing everything wrong with her,
                physically and mentally, without stopping to take a breath. There would be thousands of details I could
                belittle her for, laugh at her for, and feel disgusted about. Why is it that we find it so comfortable
                and easy to hurt ourselves? I could never in a million years imaagine saying such awful things about
                someone to their face in the ways that I could to myself in the mirror.
            </p>
            <p> I took another perspective on this photograph and imagined myself sitting in an empty room across from
                her. I imagined this six year old version of me, the version who would never stop talking and couldn’t
                sit still in her seat for more than a while. She is the version of me that could look people in the eye
                when speaking and carry conversations for hours without even needing a topic. I find that I feel a
                little jealous imagining this kinder and more confident version of me. What changed? Why? Is it really
                such a normal, common experience to deteriorate as a human being when you get older? As I sit across
                from her in this scene my mind has forged, I imagine all of the flaws I have pointed out to myself over
                the years; however, instead of directing them at myself, I make her the subject of these insults.
            </p>
            <p>“Your jawline is too round.”</p>
            <p> “Your eyes are too buggish.”
            </p>
            <p> “Your teeth are too crooked.”
            </p>
            <p> “Your nose is not straight.”
            </p>
            <p>“Your lips are uneven.”</p>
            <p>“Your knees point outward when you stand.”</p>
            <p>“Your ears are not symmetrical.”</p>
            <p>“You have too many wrinkles on the knuckles of your fingers.”</p>
            <p>And as I go on, the insults get more niche and detailed. They become so specific that I begin to wonder
                where on Earth I even developed these insecurities from in the first place. Are these things that other
                people notice about me too? The more insults I throw at this six year old girl, the more I see her
                squirm in my mind. She is uncomfortable, uneasy, and on the verge of tears: she is me and she is
                hurting. But I go on and on without hesitation. The mean words keep pouring out and suddenly I feel a
                tear roll down my own face. The salty taste brings me back from the nightmare I created in my
                imagination. I couldn’t look at the photograph anymore. I felt so horrible for saying such awful things
                to that girl, me, that I could not look her in the eyes any longer, despite her being a still photo with
                no real emotion in this state. I realized, if she were truly here, right in front of me in reality, what
                would she do? If I conntinued my reoccurring rituals of staring into a blurry, tearful image of myself
                in the mirror, picking myself apart until there is nothing left of me, would she cry with me? Would she
                think to herself, “this is an older version of myself that hates me”? Would she feel the same burning
                sensation in her heart and nausea swirling in her stomach when she blames herself for being the innate
                reason I look the way I do now?
            </p>
            <p> I’m learning to be kinder to myself whenever I can be. I know myself as being full of love and respect
                but for some reason these conditions do not extend to myself as they do to the people around me. I seem
                to spend so much time giving my kindness to others that I forget to spare some for myself sometimes. I
                hope the next time I see myself, whether it be ea photograph or in a mirror, my reflection will show
                that six year old version of me so I can apologize for my harshness. I hope she can help me learn to
                love us.
            </p>
