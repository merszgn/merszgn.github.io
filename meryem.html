        <p><i>In three short essays, I will do my best to explain to you exactly who I am through metaphoric usage of
                fruit and insects. I have always struggled to explain myself and my thoughts through literal sense, so
                hopefully this will help you understand me better.</i></p>

                <p>My favorite fruit has consistently been pomegranates. In a verbatim sense, the red juice and crunch
                    of its seeds fills an aperture in my body that I forget exists. Metaphorically–yet so literally–,
                    this fruit is my soul. One can husk the outer shell to get to the sweet core; the memories, the
                    psyche, and the accumulation of human emotion. Its sole existence is a manifestation of human life.
                    Unlike other fruit, it offers knowledge. Solitaries suchlike seedless grapes and coconuts only
                    embody humanity of a trivial scale and a vain confidence beyond inferior comprehension. But what
                    does a pomegranate suggest? Does it personify all aspects of extant life or detach the virtuous and
                    heinous into conventional classes?</p>

                <p>My mind is a disarray of perplexity and complicated thoughts that I cannot elucidate to most others.
                    I struggle to find the words to illustrate my habits whilst my peers make sense of the world simply
                    by being. I cannot find it in myself to do the same. I have tried. I have attempted to sit and
                    understand the world through simply… <i>understanding</i> it. Telling myself the complexity is
                    fabricated and present to deceive me. Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not. Regardless, I am unable
                    to relate to this approach of reasoning. I have succumbed and accepted that my brain just does not
                    experience and make sense of things the way that others’ do. I search for the intricacy in
                    everything and lose myself in the process. One day, I recall becoming so weary of hauling around
                    this hunger for clarity in an uncertain world. I wanted to stop pinning the blame of being so
                    burdensome onto myself and needed to channel the energy into something else, something that could
                    understand everything without saying anything. And in that moment, in front of me on the table, was
                    a bowl of pomegranates. They heaped up onto each other and possessed vibrant hues of distinct shades
                    of red. The skin bruised and coarse, speckled and imperfect. The core attached together by intricate
                    webs of membrane and seeds comprising the bliss and the mold of its fruit. What a perfectly
                    imperfect manifestation of what it means to be human. So, I did what I had to and I began to condemn
                    the heaviness of existing onto pomegranates. It began as a senseless bit; I would go through
                    agonizing misery and convince myself it was the pomegranates’ fault. Everything terrible happened
                    because of the pomegranates. After, I would consume their seeds and swallow the sadness to dissolve
                    in my stomach into utter nothingness. The world started to make sense through this minor delusion of
                    mine. Eventually, it ceased being a senseless bit. I began to genuinely have myself convinced that
                    all my unluckiness and fortune were results of the existence of pomegranates. However, this dilemma
                    was not all that tricky. The complexity within it was the psychological factor affecting me. At this
                    point of my awkward, perturbing self-experiment, even the slightest emotions brought the scent of
                    pomegranates to my senses. The dry smell of sweet, mouth-watering seeds would relentlessly follow me
                    anywhere I went. Over time, I became increasingly obsessed with this peculiar vision of pomegranates
                    I had established in my head. I suppose it was a result of finally having an outlet that helped me
                    grasp the world. I was too afraid to let go of this idea now, too afraid to revert back to my numbed
                    lack of realism. It was like an addiction consuming my brain. Everything traced back to pomegranates
                    in one way or another.</p>

                <p>The idea of the pomegranate became an intangible concept. The fruit no longer existed to me; it was
                    as if the symbolism of it was the true definition of the word. I had gone so far into my delusion
                    that pomegranates seemed like an invention I came up with myself. It was my brain. I thought of it
                    in this sense. My head was a pomegranate. My skin and skull being the red shell of the fruit. My
                    brain was the seeds. Each seed contains memories, nightmares, dreams, voices, photographs, entries:
                    everything. I am unsure around what point in this timeline that I had started to think this way. I
                    did not care to remember, either. It was enough for me that my brain had calmed down at last. I no
                    longer think of questions with no answers. I no longer become frustrated with the variables of the
                    universe. I focus on what I know, and what I know is that I am okay. In all transparency, it is
                    quite an underwhelming story to tell. I feel that I miss many components of how I came to process
                    the world in this way. I guess those components have become swallowed seeds. I have forgotten them
                    and they have dissolved in stomach acid.</p>
