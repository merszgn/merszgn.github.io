<a href="https://meryem.earth">meryem.earth</a> is my personal project website—a space where I share my thoughts, passions, and creative journeys. It serves as an extension of myself, blending personal reflections, art, and writing into a digital archive that evolves alongside me. The site embodies my love for literature, music, and immersive experiences. Every detail reflects my desire to create something intimate and meaningful.

For more of my writing and poetic musings, you can also visit <a href="https://poetic-exile.github.io">[POETIC-EXILE]</a>, meryem.earth’s sister website. [POETIC-EXILE] exists as an archive of Nouranthys,preserving its essence as both a personal sanctuary and a growing narrative.
