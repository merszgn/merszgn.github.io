Hi all! I have decided to host my website through Github Pages. I used to be located at <a href="https://meryem.neocities.org" target=_blank>https://meryem.neocities.org</a>, where I felt that the coding environment wasn't as efficient as Github is. The predominant motive for my transfer was the fact that I could push commits through VSCode directly instead of having to upload my new files and changes manually as I would on Neocities. Additionally, I find that the navigation on Github offers more authority over how I want my website to be presented and such. That's really all for now. Thanks!
