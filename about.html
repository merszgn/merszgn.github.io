                I could not decide between writing short essays or an actual autobiography for this page, so I have
                compromised by including both! Once you scroll further down, you will be greeted by five different tabs
                all about me. The first, "Prologue", will be an actual description of who I am. The other four,
                "i."-"iv.", are my short essays. My essays all speak obscurely and hermeneutically about parts of myself
                that you'll have to read between the lines of to understand.
            </p>
            <p>This page recieves regular updates whenever I feel that my prologue must change to fit the person I am of that certain day. It may range from an alteration to a sentence to a completely new prologue altogether.</p>

                <h2 translate="no">Pomegranatalia</h2>
                <p><i>“Is it desire that fuels the heavy heart of a creation so disappointed by the inventions of its
                        likeness? If so, what desire is in its capacity? Where does the creation look to for answers if
                        not a higher being, The God, who invented the creations who invent? If its purpose, so to say,
                        is to endure and never reach a higher design, why does it exist? The solitude of these creations
                        creates, from nothing, the longing to reach a full potential that is intangible and a likelihood
                        of improbable existence. However, if you disbelieve in such a concept, who controls the probable
                        and improbable? A maddening invention is the mind, its volume brimmed with conflicts and
                        overlooked cognitive dissonance. The creation can not be the creator. There is no use in arguing
                        such an ill, backward concept with no proof of existence. So, creation of inventions, who
                        controls the probable and improbable? If one cannot prove the likes of their own existence, what
                        is their likelihood of improbable existence? A concept that fledges back and forth between its
                        own reasoning is of no use defending or arguing. If this is the case, why do creations, the
                        creators of inventions, twist the mind, brimmed with arrogance this time, into a substance
                        unwilling to cooperate, creating simultaneously a surplus of disappointment? When the heavy
                        heart of certain creations witness these calamities, their empty hearts, known to nor of
                        nothing, fill inversely with hatred of its likeness. The malevolence of its heart minimizes the
                        effect of its mind, brimming with unnecessary inquiry, taking on what it struggles to comprehend
                        and invents new concepts unknown unto itself. So, tell me creators of inventions, who is it that
                        creates you?”</i></p>

                <p>In a verbatim sense, the red juice and crunch of a pomegranate’s seeds fills an aperture in my body
                    that I forget exists. Metaphorically–yet so literally–, this fruit is my soul. One can husk the
                    exocarp to get to the sweet core; the memories, the psyche, and the accumulation of human emotion.
                    Its sole existence is a manifestation of human life. Unlike other fruit, it offers knowledge.
                    Solitaries suchlike seedless grapes and coconuts only embody humanity of a trivial scale and a vain
                    confidence beyond our comprehension. But what does a pomegranate suggest? Does it personify all
                    aspects of extant life or detach the virtuous and heinous into conventional classes?</p>

                <p>The desires of this world are laborious to entertain. I find myself lost in a struggle of balancing
                    tangible longings and an inexplicable need to understand the world from a transcendent perspective.
                    The struggles end far from this mark. Elaborating my thoughts to others, even those of likeness,
                    becomes a battle between my tongue and mind. It is with a heavy heart, full of discontent, that I
                    have let go of sharing the natures of my mind as a means to save my sanity. In place, I find myself
                    confiding in the portrait of fruit and the intangible. To be more precise, pomegranates have become
                    a key in my heart where I contain the depths of myself. The membranes hold seeds, similar to the
                    memories I hold in my heart, and cannot be picked apart until I inevitably crush one out of
                    existence. Nonetheless, it is dissimilar to agony. There is no melancholy or bittersweet resentment
                    involved in these recollections. It webs together pieces of myself I cannot expound and innovates
                    out of the muddle. Perhaps one may call it fabled, but I see it through eyes unakin to regular
                    philosophy. The disillusionment caused by our tradition of scrutinizing through one lens is a factor
                    that can be transformed with the simple act of removing the outer shell of our pomegranates and
                    leaving vulnerability to be determined by the possibility that we will not be distressed.</p>

                <p>Though how may one come about this result? What tragedies must one suffer to establish such a bond
                    between the veins of their heart and the veins of a fruit? Succinctly, the answer is none. No
                    distress must exist in order for such to materialize. Certainly, it might accelerate the process and
                    strike significantly rougher, but you must apprehend that no quantity of psychiatry or even divine
                    intervention can provide a justification for why or how a promise like this occurs. Some matters are
                    meant to stay a mystery. Few things are meant to be comprehended with no logical reasoning, yet, by
                    such luck, this remains to be one of those scarce conceptions. If you must have a reason to believe,
                    then you may be assured that you do not possess a certain prolificity in your own soul. Notions made
                    for everybody are not notions: these are the verities of life and therefore must not exist the way I
                    have stated.</p>
