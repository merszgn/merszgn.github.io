                I could not decide between writing short essays or an actual autobiography for this page, so I have
                compromised by including both! Once you scroll further down, you will be greeted by five different tabs
                all about me. The first, "Prologue", will be an actual description of who I am. The other four,
                "i."-"iv.", are my short essays. My essays all speak obscurely and hermeneutically about parts of myself
                that you'll have to read between the lines of to understand.
            </p>
            <p>I'm afraid you'll have to bare with me regarding the disorganization of this page. I'm working on another
                way of displaying these writings in a better system rather than five boring tabs.</p>

                <h5>Who I Am in Theory and Practice</h5>

                <p>I’m a romantic archivist of pain and meaning, drowning in my own melodramatic and theatrical sadness.
                    I’m a collector of things that made me feel something once. I repeatedly find myself in short-lived
                    states of infatuation with what could have been and what will never be. Perfumes that smell like old
                    books and vanilla bring me a sense of comfort that I cannot find internally. I try to sift through
                    life
                    to filter out the important elements so I can focus on the small details. I’ve been told that
                    “over-emotional” and “hyper-perceptive” are understatements when asked to describe myself. I have
                    many
                    favorite quotes, but Ruth Ozeki’s writing in A Tale for the Time Being makes me feel like I was born
                    to
                    read this excerpt:</p>

                <p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 5em; margin-right: 5em;">“The moment I saw the gate I had a
                    strong thought to turn around and throw myself headfirst down the
                    steep stone steps or just let myself free-fall backward into the pillowy softness of eternity, and
                    it
                    wouldn't matter if I bumped and bounced like a cabbage all the way down until I hit the bottom and
                    then
                    rolled out to sea, because at least I'd be safe and dead.”
                    ― Ruth Ozeki, A Tale for the Time Being</p>

                <p>I find myself in the same dilemma quite often. The convenience of falling back and giving up is so
                    much
                    more appealing than it sounds. Sometimes, I’d rather take the wounds and scars of never knowing what
                    is
                    behind that gate to save myself some peace of mind. The only issue is exactly that: I’ll never know
                    what
                    is behind. Whenever I feel like I’m struggling to make a choice, I remember this quote and decide
                    what
                    is best for me: pushing that gate open.</p>

                <p>On a much simpler level, I’m just a seventeen year old girl in the Bay Area who likes to read
                    microscopically between the lines of virtually everything. I’m a capricorn–you know you care– thanks
                    to
                    my lovely birthday, the fourth of January. I was born in Tokat, Turkey. I’m an older sister and an
                    only
                    daughter. I love cats and I have one of my very own named Velvet. I hate lead pencils and will use
                    an
                    erasable pen in place of them whenever I can, but will use a fountain pen in place of an erasable
                    pen
                    whenever I can–there’s a very specific hierarchy that I’m loyal to.</p>

                <p>I spend most of my time either writing, reading, or studying. I love hermeneutic literature for a
                    variety of reasons and try to mold my writings in the same ways. As for reading, I do prefer
                    fictional
                    works that embody emotional, reflective, and gloomy themes. I’ve never considered one book to be my
                    all-time favorite, but I do have treasured authors: Paulo Coelho, Jerry Spinelli, Donna Tartt,
                    Khaled
                    Hosseini, and Arthur Conan Doyle, to name a few. Quite a lot of their works have inspired my passion
                    for
                    knowledge. I view studying as an art form rather than a chore. I take pride in gathering
                    information,
                    whether academic or a personal voyage, almost as much as I love to share it. It’s something I find
                    relaxing and enjoyable–only if you let it be.</p>

                <p>Academia is a significant factor in my life. My quest for information extends far deeper than simply
                    passing a class or memorizing a fact. I tested out of high school in my second year to pursue my
                    interest in biological sciences at a collegiate level. After completing my bachelor’s degree, I hope
                    to
                    continue my education in the medical field and earn the title of being a board-certified
                    anesthesiologist. I’ve been told that I plan too far ahead and that I should not set my mind on a
                    desire
                    that could change at any moment, but I do not see it that way. One of the phenomena regarding
                    anesthesia
                    that lured me in is anesthetic dreaming. This state of consciousness–or rather lack thereof–has
                    barely
                    been observed due to its difficulty to study. My main goal with anesthesiology is to contribute
                    significantly to this phenomena by understanding how this dream state is triggered, its effects on
                    the
                    human brain, and whether there are any potential benefits to being in this condition.</p>

                <h5>Things I Live For</h5>

                <p>Despite what I named this section, a lot of the things I like are not things I live for but rather
                    things I live because of. It’s not often that I listen to music but when I do, it absolutely shifts
                    the
                    trajectory of my day. I try to listen to music that isn’t too moody because I’ve found that it
                    heavily
                    influences the way I feel. I went a couple months without listening to music last year and felt an
                    increase in my happiness throughout the day. I steer clear of anything too gloomy now so I don’t
                    fall
                    back into the “I’m sad and I don’t know why” rabbit hole. Fiona Apple, Sade, Erykah Badu, and Imogen
                    Heap are my most played artists, according to Spotify.</p>

                <p>I hate to admit it, but my favorite piece of film media has been Twilight ever since I first saw it
                    in
                    middle school. I’m a longstanding fan of the Twilight Saga and probably its biggest apologist. If
                    blind
                    adoration is real, then it seems to exist between me and Stephenie Meyer’s despicable writing. As
                    embarrassing as it is, I’m a huge Team Edward fan and will live by this until the day I die,
                    probably.
                    Among all of my Twilight mania, I’m also a fan of some actually good pieces of cinema! I’ve never
                    been
                    huge on movies but I love a good unnecessarily long show. My most recent fixations have been Suits
                    and
                    Invincible. Other shows I’ve been a long-term fan of are Peaky Blinders, Great Pretender, You, and
                    The
                    Good Place.</p>

                <p>I also live for romance. It’s not in the way you might think of. I’m speaking of the romantic nature
                    of
                    life, being alive, and ourselves. My personal definition of romance is “the details we don’t notice
                    that
                    keep us alive”: the romantic tension between your lungs and the air you breathe, the emotional
                    prance
                    your eyes perform to glance around, the intimate tango your fingers indulge in to help you through
                    your
                    day. It’s all some sort of love affair that you pay no attention to because you don’t really need
                    to. On
                    the other hand, my thoughts on typical romance are much more quixotic. I hold a very idealistic and
                    unrealistic view on romance that I don’t think I’ll ever get to experience in this life. I also
                    wouldn’t
                    settle for anything less than, so I don’t bother worrying about something I know will never happen.
                </p>

                <h5>Hobbies and Things I Enjoy</h5>

                <p>I don’t like hoarding things, but I do collect perfume bottles and books. I have a plentiful amount
                    of
                    perfume bottles and packaging hidden away inside my closet, due to both sentimental value and the
                    aesthetic appeal of how some bottles look. None of them are anything very luxurious, though; I don’t
                    like spending too much on needless things like scents. As for books, I’d give a lot of money for a
                    special copy of works from an author I admire. I possess an anniversary edition of The Alchemist by
                    Paulo Coelho, gifted from a friend, that I hold very dear to my heart. It was the first book by
                    Coelho
                    that I ever read. I’m also interested in growing my collection of older books, preferably decades
                    old,
                    and gradually add to it whenever I come across a sweet bookshop.</p>

                <p>Other than writing it out, I like expressing my feelings through music as well. I’ve been playing
                    guitar
                    for almost a decade and I’ve been self-studying piano recently. I took lessons when I was younger
                    but
                    never felt the appeal that I felt towards guitar. I’m hoping to bring back some of my prodigy skills
                    with a slow learning process. Piano is a difficult instrument to teach yourself, though, so I’m
                    hoping
                    I’ll have the motivation and means to get pretty far in this new experience. I’ve written a couple
                    of
                    songs and performed a couple of times but I don’t think I’ve ever been able to perform to my best
                    ability (I have stage fright). Music has been a good learning opportunity for me. I’ve felt an
                    increase
                    in my self-esteem since I started pursuing it publicly.</p>

                <h5>In Another Life</h5>

                <p>I’ve always dreamt of having my own bookstore. Something cozy and small. Maybe sell coffee on the
                    side.
                    If I had the financial means to do it, I’d probably go for it. I would’ve majored in finance or
                    something and managed my own coffee-shop-book-store building. It’s a nice ambition to think about
                    and
                    sometimes I get my hopes up that if the doctor thing works out for me, I’ll retire early and invest
                    in
                    this daydream. I already have everything planned out for it, all from what I’d call it down to the
                    playlist I’d put on the speakers. Sometimes I fall asleep imagining myself in this building, making
                    a
                    latte and then going out to put some books back on the shelves. I’d water the plants hanging from
                    the
                    ceilings and wipe down the windows, put some kibble out front for any dogs passing by, chat with
                    regulars, anything to make my dream seem real.</p>

            </div>

            <div id="" class="tabcontent">
                <h2>Pomegranatalia</h2>
                <p class="sub-ital">“Is it desire that fuels the heavy heart of a creation so disappointed by the
                    inventions of its
                    likeness? If so, what desire is in its capacity? Where does the creation look to for answers if not
                    a higher being, The God, who invented the creations who invent? If its purpose, so to say, is to
                    endure and never reach a higher design, why does it exist? The solitude of these creations creates,
                    from nothing, the longing to reach a full potential that is intangible and a likelihood of
                    improbable existence. However, if you disbelieve in such a concept, who controls the probable and
                    improbable? A maddening invention is the mind, its volume brimmed with conflicts and overlooked
                    cognitive dissonance. The creation can not be the creator. There is no use in arguing such an ill,
                    backward concept with no proof of existence. So, creation of inventions, who controls the probable
                    and improbable? If one cannot prove the likes of their own existence, what is their likelihood of
                    improbable existence? A concept that fledges back and forth between its own reasoning is of no use
                    defending or arguing. If this is the case, why do creations, the creators of inventions, twist the
                    mind, brimmed with arrogance this time, into a substance unwilling to cooperate, creating
                    simultaneously a surplus of disappointment? When the heavy heart of certain creations witness these
                    calamities, their empty hearts, known to nor of nothing, fill inversely with hatred of its likeness.
                    The malevolence of its heart minimizes the effect of its mind, brimming with unnecessary inquiry,
                    taking on what it struggles to comprehend and invents new concepts unknown unto itself. So tell me,
                    creators of inventions, who is it that creates you?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a verbatim sense, the red juice and crunch of a pomegranate’s seeds fills an aperture in my body
                    that
                    I forget exists. Metaphorically–yet so literally–, this fruit is my soul. One can husk the exocarp
                    to
                    get to the sweet core; the memories, the psyche, and the accumulation of human emotion. Its sole
                    existence is a manifestation of human life. Unlike other fruit, it offers knowledge. Solitaries
                    suchlike
                    seedless grapes and coconuts only embody humanity of a trivial scale and a vain confidence beyond
                    our
                    comprehension. But what does a pomegranate suggest? Does it personify all aspects of extant life or
                    detach the virtuous and heinous into conventional classes?</p>
                <p>
                    The desires of this world are laborious to entertain. I find myself lost in a struggle of balancing
                    tangible longings and an inexplicable need to understand the world from a transcendent perspective.
                    The struggles end far from this mark. Elaborating my thoughts to others, even those of likeness,
                    becomes a battle between my tongue and mind. It is with a heavy heart, full of discontent, that I
                    have let go of sharing the natures of my mind as a means to save my sanity. In place, I find myself
                    confiding in the portrait of fruit and the intangible. To be more precise, pomegranates have become
                    a key in my heart where I contain the depths of myself. The membranes hold seeds, similar to the
                    memories I hold in my heart, and cannot be picked apart until I inevitably crush one out of
                    existence. Nonetheless, it is dissimilar to agony. There is no melancholy or bittersweet resentment
                    involved in these recollections. It webs together pieces of myself I cannot expound and innovates
                    out of the muddle. Perhaps one may call it fabled, but I see it through eyes unakin to regular
                    philosophy. The disillusionment caused by our tradition of scrutinizing through one lens is a factor
                    that can be transformed with the simple act of removing the outer shell of our pomegranates and
                    leaving vulnerability to be determined by the possibility that we will not be distressed.

                    Though how may one come about this result? What tragedies must one suffer to establish such a bond
                    between the veins of their heart and the veins of a fruit? Succinctly, the answer is none. No
                    distress must exist in order for such to materialize. Certainly, it might accelerate the process and
                    strike significantly rougher, but you must apprehend that no quantity of psychiatry or even divine
                    intervention can provide a justification for why or how a promise like this occurs. Some matters are
                    meant to stay a mystery. Few things are meant to be comprehended with no logical reasoning, yet, by
                    such luck, this remains to be one of those scarce conceptions. If you must have a reason to believe,
                    then you may be assured that you do not possess a certain prolificity in your own soul. Notions made
                    for everybody are not notions: these are the verities of life and therefore must not exist the way I
                    have stated.
