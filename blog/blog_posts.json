Originally, I was planning on using an SQL file to store the data nad parse it with python but I decided to go with JSON instead since it would be easier. If I end up with way too many posts then I might have to switch to postgresql, but for now I'll have to bare with this. I'll also work on the css and layout of this page later. I'm really tired. I might reuse this code for my update log, too. I'll have to tweak it a bit though.",
