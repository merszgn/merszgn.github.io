I also decided to make it more fun (mostly for myself Lol) and add passwords to some posts!! I added a sample post below this just to try it out. You can find the password in my genblog.py file in the github repo for this website. I'll probably change it every so often to entertain myself.<br>The CSS for this part of the site is suuuper bland right now, I'm thinking of fixing it over the weekend. Right now, this will just have to do! I also need some ideas for how I want it to look... I was thinking about \"magazine style\" but I'm not really sure how I'd go about it without totally overcomplicating it. If you have any ideas, send them my way!! I'll even credit you at the bottom of each blog page loool you can either add to the github discussions or dm me via discord @ pomergranate :) okay goodnight i'm so tired djskfjhdflhsdfha",
