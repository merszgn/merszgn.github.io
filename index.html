        <h1 class="title">Who am I?</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Meryem and I'm a Turkish-Muslim university student residing in the Bay Area of California. I
            tested out of high school in my sophomore year and am now majoring in biology. I am interested in
            going to medical school to get an M.D. in anesthesiology. <a href="my-purpose">"Why anesthesiology?"</a>
        </p>
        <p>I've always had an interest in web development and design. Since 2020, I have been on the internet creating
            websites and pursuing this hobby publicly. I started my first website on <a
                href="https://neocities.org/browse" target="_blank">Neocities</a>. I have had multiple anonymous
            websites on the internet since starting this
            journey. Now, I've become interested in dedicating a webpage entirely to myself and my thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>This is my own personal Earth. I consider it to be a separated part of myself which I must provide care to.
            My
            biggest goal with <span class="gradient-text">meryem.earth</span> is to show others that having their
            own "Earth" is the most important part of life. It doesn't have to be a website, necessarily, but an
            extension
            of your mind that allows you to express yourself freely; <i>something that brings you peace and joy.</i> You
            can read more about my purpose <a href="/my-purpose">here</a>.

        <section>
            <img src="photos/articleone.jpg" /><br />
            <h3><a href="/articleone">Article One</a></h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
                There will be an Article One shortly... Whenever I feel like writing one.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <img src="photos/articletwo.jpg" /><br />
            <h3><a href="/articletwo">Article Two</a></h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
                And an Article Two, as well. I have a couple more things on the checklist.
            </p>

        <section>

            <h3><a href="/articlethree">Article Three</a></h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
                An Article Three would also fit into this small polaroid section.

            </h1>
            <p style="font-style: normal;">
                <a href="https://poetic-exile.github.io/" target="_blank">[POETIC-EXILE]</a> is my sub-website dedicated
                to a worldcraft titled Nouranthys. I am working on obtaining a domain name for it soon, but for now it
                is fully hosted by Github Pages.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: normal;">
                I created Nouranthys several years ago, having changed the name of it several times before settling on
                this one. It has recently been going through a mass change due to the files being deleted off of my
                drive a couple months ago in 2024.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: normal;">
                The new Nouranthys will be straying far from homebrew campaign writing. I plan to utilize the website as
                an archive for the lore and literature relevant to Nouranthys. Due to this, the website will be
                performance-heavy and reliant on scripts to function. I recommend you turn off any script blockers
                before you venture into [POETIC-EXILE].
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: normal;">
                I appreciate all interest in my worldcrafts! If you'd like to talk to me about it, my email is always
                open for discussion!
            </p>
